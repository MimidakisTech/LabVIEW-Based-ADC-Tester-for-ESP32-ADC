# LabVIEW-Based-ADC-Tester-for-ESP32-ADC
Design of a Virtual Instrument in LabVIEW Community Edition for verification of accuracy and proper operation of the 12 bit SAR ADC of the ESP32 Microcontroller.

As we can see on an internet search the ESP32 ADC is not operating as it's supposed to. The problems a maker or an engineer faces when using the ESP32 ADC are noise when measuring and low accuracy. By low accuracy we mean that the voltage that the device "reads" does not match the input voltage.
There are a lot of reasons for this behavior such as noise from the CPU, Bluetooth or WiFi module.
